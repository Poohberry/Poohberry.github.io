	<h1> About Me </h1> 
	<p>My name is Ellie smith, I am a current Business management major at University of Maine orono. <br>
	I want to run my own bakery in portland some day and I hope I will learn the skills to do so at Umaine. <br>
	My favorite animal is the seal! I love seals! <br>
	They are super cute and very round, the best aspects of a animal if I do say so myself. </p>
